The Game of Blackjack
=====================
by Fawn Wong and Kevin Kan (Period 2)

This is Blackjack!

Simply put, this is a game against the dealer. When you begin your game, the dealer is at the top of the screen. 

You are at the bottom. The order goes like this: Player on the left, You, Player on the right, and finally the Dealer.

The dealer will begin the game by dealing each player two cards. One faced down, one faced up. 

You start the game with $1000. You must bet at least $50 to play. 
If you win, you get your own bet back, and that same amount extra. If you lose, you lose the amount you bet. 

The objective of the game is to get a point total of 21. Each card has its own point value. 
A are worth 1 or 11. 2-10 are worth exactly what the card says. J, Q, K are all worth 10. 

During your turn, you have the options to "hit" or "stand". 
When you "hit," you are asking for another random card out of the dealer's deck. 
When you "stand," you are telling the dealer you are done getting more cards, and he can move on to the next player. 

Good luck!
